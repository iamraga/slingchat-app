# Slingchat
A Realtime Text and Video chat application using **React** on the front end, with **NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library** on the back end.
Video chat is build using **simple-peer** which is wrapped around **Web Real-Time Communications (Web RTC)** technology.

You can gather your friends, create a room and start chatting right away.\
Access the slingchat app [here](https://sling-chat.netlify.app/).\
Enter your name and the unique room name that you want to join.
Choose whether the room members will text or video chat and join room.

P.S. Currently only 2 users can video chat in a room. I will be working on increasing this number.
